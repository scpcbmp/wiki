| Supported | Recommended | Minimum |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **x86** and **x64** only! | **2** CPU Core(s) | **1** CPU Core |

A dedicated server can run perfectly fine on a single CPU core. However in `Breach Mode`, it's recommended to have at least **two** (2) or **more** core(s) to run. 

**_NOTE: For macOS and Linux users, a more powerful CPU may be required in order to have smooth gameplay._**

## <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/7310/7310382.png" width="26" height="26" /> GPU

All dedicated server(s) are required to have a GPU in order to run the server. However, you can use a GPU emulator to run the server but in exchange it will take more CPU usage.

| Maximum | Recommended | Minimum |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **4GB** RAM | **2GB** RAM | **1GB** RAM |

A windows dedicated server must have at least **1GB** of RAM (or maximum of **4GB** of RAM) to run.

**_NOTE: A Linux or macOS server(s) may require more ram if you need to use a GPU emulator to run._**

-----

| Recommended | Minimum |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| **10GB** HDD/SSD | **1GB** HDD/SSD |

A minimum of **1GB** (HDD or SSD) of storage is required to run the server. But over time, the server may take up more storage space due save logs, bans, etc. A **10GB** storage is recommended for longer uses. 

-----
## <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/7310/7310353.png" width="26" height="26" /> Internet Access

| Recommended | Minimum |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| **10** MB/s | **2** MB/s |

At least **10** MB/s (or equivalent to **80** Mbps) is required for server to work properly with voice chat. However, if you use the server without voice chat, you can go as low as **2** MB/s (or equivalent to **16** Mbps).

**_NOTE: The information above was provided by Head Developer of the Multiplayer Mod._**

If you wish to run a server 24/7, you might need to set up your router to utilize a static IP address. However, a static IP might not be required if you simply intend to play with your friends.

The server program was created and developed for Windows; however, utilizing Wine (on Linux) or a good emulator on macOS should be enough to run the server.
