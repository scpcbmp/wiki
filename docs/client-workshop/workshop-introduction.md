# **Introduction to Workshop Modding**
{: .fs-9 .fw-600 }

Welcome! Since version `v1.2.0` release, it is now possible to add/create modifications for SCP: Containment Breach Multiplayer directly into the Workshop. In this documentation you will be learning about all the information from tools used in creating a mod to adding them to Steam Workshop!

To access the workshop click [here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1782380/workshop/), or you can find it directly in the game tab called "Workshop" shown below.

The workshop works by clicking the `Subscribe` button on an item that you are interested in and then after that, normally launch the game. However, due to the **_limitations_** and **_functionality_** of the game, you are more than likely going to run into a bug or a Memory Access Violation (MAV) error. This may be caused by if the mod(s) overlap or come into conflict with another.
